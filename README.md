There's been over a year since I last pushed update to this repository. Last push time was 2023/5/4 and today is 2024/7/20. One reason is I’ve been busy with school project, the other is NFT market looks not really good recent months. Overall, I still love NFTs so I decided to completely rewrite this bot, make it support multi chain NFT and make commands not only available for guilds, but everywhere. You can use commands in public server, private server and even in DM. Will start working on this from now on.
